## The Creation Process
Playlist was my first project, and it was a great learning experience. I started by brainstorming different ideas for a web application, and eventually settled on a simple customizable playlist. I made this project right after completing the [Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask and Python in 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-developer-bootcamp-flask-python/), which is a course that I finished and got inspired by one of the projects to make this project. I used HTML and CSS for the front-end, and for the back-end I used Python and Flask, also Jinja2 as a template engine. I wanted to do a simple project to practice the concepts I learned and prove to myself that I can do a nice website. I hope you enjoy it!
